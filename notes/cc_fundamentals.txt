CELL - Cloud Computing: Cloud Computing Fundamentals (PLE)

Goals:
	- Explain concept of cloud computing
	- Distinguish between different cloud offerings
	- Definte key tech advancements that enable modern cloud solutions
	- List 3 common cloud computing architectural models

I. Definition of Cloud Computing
	- "An approach to providing a convergence of computing services over the network"
	- Branding & marketing of existing tech has evolved & improved
	- Examples of Cloud Computing characteristics:
		- Virtualization Technologies
		- Grid Computing
		- Distributed Design,
		- Federated Enterprise IT Management

	Quiz:
		1. Cloud Computing's appeal towards smaller enterprises = low cost of entry to cloud solutions through minimized capital spending
		2. Client application interface importance < functionality importance because:
			- Multiple interfaces can sit above functionality, leading to flexible interfaces
			- User interface/experience easier to learn/use because application look & feel is becoming more similar
			- Value proposition to more educated tech users shifted over time
		3. Typical Cloud Computing Characteristics:
			- Server-centric processing & storage
			- Minimized startup investment
			- Simple, rapid deployment & operations
			- High availability
			- Client interface not as important as functionality


II. Underlying Trends of Powering Clouds
	A. Software as a Service (SaaS)
		- Software that provides services for users: "Interface is the value, not how/where it runs"
			- Replaces raditional applications installed on each machine
		- Advancements:
			- Flexible software models => more customizability
				- ex: allow software to distribute the load of running between client & server
			- Self-contained (2) multi-tenant (1) code
				(1) Code can run one time and service multiple users (as opposed to traditional applications servicing one user per instance, e.g. MS Word)
				(2) Very few, if any, dependencies (e.g. framework not needed to be installed to run software; SaaS comes ready to run as is)
			- Processing can be redirected
				- SaaS applications can dynamically optimize running their code
					- e.g. Can pull more server resources if heavy processing underway; can reallocate parts of code to run at different locations (like unused resources) to redistribute the load of the processes
			- Form follows function
				- Consumers prioritizing robust & efficient application solutions over usable interface
		- Examples of Cloud Computing Offerings:
			Applications: Salesforce, AT&T Mobile Enterprise Application Platform, Google applications (gmail, google cloud console, etc.)
			Storage: Cloudfiles, Box, ATT Synaptic Storage as a Service
			Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Development Env or OS as a service: Cloudo, iCUBE, eyeOS
			App Platforms: Exchange, Office, Sharepoint, Oracle, Apache
			
	B. Virtualization
		- Decouples computing elements from each other (e.g. Hardware, OS, Services, Core applications)
			- Allows software to manage different components of a system individually, which lets users scale up or down as needed
		- Advancements:
			- Increasing stability, scalable performance (e.g. User's processes are requiring more resources -> provider can easily offer up unused components for a cost)
		- Examples:
			- Hardware:
				- AMD-V, Intel VT-x (CPUs) offer virtualization capabilities to consumers
			-Software:
				- Hyper-V, VMWare, Windows Server, OVM
				
	C. Utility-Based Computing Model
		- Pay for what you use
			- Allows small- & medium-sized companies to scale much easier (don't need to invest a lot of capital on developing & hiring a team to manage storage/processing anymore; can purchase resources as needed via utility-based computing model companies)
		- Examples:
			- ATT Synaptic Compute as a Service, Amazon WebServices, Google App Engine, VMForce
			
	Quiz:
		1. Multi-Tenant Code = "Scalable and efficient development approach to writing software for cloud services"
		2. The advancement of what three computing trends make cloud computing prevalent today:
			- SaaS
			- Virtualization
			- Utility-Based Computing Model
		3. What virtualization advancements have enabled modern cloud computing solutions?
			- Minimal resource consumption of hypervisor & host operating environment
			- Rich virtualization support across software & hardware platforms
			- Implementation of virtualization support within Intel & AMD CPUs
		4. Marketing trends that fueled advancement of the Utility-Based Computing Model
			- Flexible pricing models
			- Fixed-cost options for service consumers
			- Opportunity for zero-priced entry
			- Customers willing to pay price point necessary to drive supply channels

III. Cloud Computing Models
	- Models: describe where cloud resources exist & how resources interact
	A. Public Cloud
		- Internet-accessible resources billed by usage
		- Clients interacting directly with cloud computing service provider
		- Single point-of-interface for clients
	
	B. Private Cloud (Traditional model)
		- Data center providing cloud-like services
	
	C. Hybrid Cloud
		- Combination of private & public cloud computing (internal & external components form a solution)
			- Ex: ATT provides 80% of resources for enterprise needs (network connectivity, storage), another provider provides the rest of the 20% (data-processing)
			- Ex: Client computers on a corporate network connected to corporate data center (private) & other cloud computing services providers (public)
		Federated Hybrid Cloud:
			- For companies requiring industry/government security/privacy regulations
			- Client computers federated through corporate data center (connect to corporate data center and then through internet to cloud computing service providers)
			- Minimizes security exposure, centralizes IT
	
	Quiz:
		1. A self-sufficient, enterprise-specific data center that provides cloud services is often classified as a: Private Cloud
		2. Benefits to implementing a Hybrid Cloud solution:
			- Increased functionality by leveraging strengths of multiple independent cloud services & applications
			- Lowering cost through multiple vendor negotiations
			- Selecting best-in-class service provider for each component
			- Supplementing IT-owned resources with cloud resources to complete a solution
		3. A client-centric cloud application that can use services from multiple clouds, both internal & external, to form a solution best describes a: Hybrid computing model
		4. A server-centric cloud application that can use services from multiple clouds, both internal and external, to form a solution best describes a: Federated Hybrid model
	
	Summary:
		Cloud computing is an advancing technology of multiple technologies providing solutions at lower cost of deployment & operations (utility-based computing), with flexible architectures for varying solutions, that are broadly available without requiring high capital -- allowing vendors/providers to convert their unused resources into profitable ones
