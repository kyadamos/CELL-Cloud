I. Cloud Computing Virtualization
	Consumer -(request)-> IT Dept
		-> Instances
			-> Hypervisors
				-> Basic hardware (e.g. bare metal servers)
	
	User makes request
		-> Cloud
			-> Southbound APIs (IT Dept somewhere in here & Cloud)
				-> Compute resources
					-> Abstracted pool of storage resources
					
II. Cloud Service Stack
	- Basic Cloud Service Stack:
		Data
			Application
				Runtime
					Middleware
						OS
							Virtualization
								Servers*
									Storage*
										Networking*
	*Hardware
	
	- Infrastructure as a Service:
		User manages: Data - OS
		Vendor manages: Virtualization (hardware & hypervisors) - Networking
	- Platform as a Service: (AWS)
		- User manages: Data & Applications
		- Vendor manages: Runtime - Networking
	- Software as a Service:
		- User manages: Data
		- Vendor manages: Applications - Networking
		
III. Cloud Types
	A. Public
		- User -> Firewall -> Service Provider Cloud (from vendor) -> Instances
		- Ex: MS Azure, AWS
		
	B. Private
		- "On-Premises" Cloud
		- User -> On-Premises Cloud -> Instances -> Firewall -> Public Network
		
	C. Hybrid

		
IV. Hybrid Cloud
	Secure Hybrid Cloud
	
		Service Provider Cloud (Public)*
			Instances**
			
		On-Premises Cloud (Private)*
			Instances**
		
		*Connected by Secure VPN Tunnel
		**Can be moved from one cloud to another

V. What is OpenStack?
	- Collection of open source technologies delivering a massively scalable cloud operating system
	- Allows user to set up their own cloud infrastructure; provides Infrustructure as a Service
	
	Keystone: Authentication/Authorization service
	Glance: Store images (different OS files)
	Nova: Computing service (launch & work with instances)
	Neutron: Networking service connecting services to each other
	Swift: Object storage
	Cinder: Block storage
	Horizon: Dashboard,
		- helps provision application developers with different instances
		- manage infrastructure as a whole
	Ceilometer: Accounting & Billing; keeps track of uptime
	Heat: Orchestration purposes

VI. OpenStack Cloud Architecture

VII. OpenStack Community
	- Open source, many people contributing
	
	A. By the Numbers

VIII. OpenStack Cloud Deployment Models

	A. On-Premises Distribution
		- customer downloads & installs OpenStack distribution within internal network
		
	B. OpenStack-based Public Cloud
		- cloud provider provides public cloud based on OpenStack and sells services
		
	C. Hosted OpenStack Private Cloud
		- cloud provider hosts an OpenStack-based private cloud (including underlying hardware & OpenStack software) for a user
		
	D. OpenStack as a Service
		- cloud provider hosts OpenStack management software as a service (basically sets up everything) & customers use software service
		
	E. Applicance-based OpenStack
		- Applicances run directly on servers and do not require an OS
		- 
		
IX. OpenStack Cloud Design Guide
	A. General Purpose
		- Ex: Small application & want to run dev test/prod on cloud infrastructure
			- VM Disk Image Library (Glance): file format that describes containers for virtual HDDs for use in VMs (e.g. VM Workstation or VirtualBox)
			- Raw Block Storage (Cinder): storage areas of different blocks, each can be controlled as an individual hard drive
			- File/Object Storage (Swift): 
			- Firewall: 
			- Load Balancers (L Bass): 
			- Software Bundles: 
	
	B. Compute Focused
		- Ex: 
			- High Performance Computing
			- Big Data Analytics using Hadoop
			- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
			- Platform as a Service (instead of Infrastructure as a Service)
			- Signal Processing for NFV
	
	C. Storage Focused
		- Ex:
			- Archive & hierarchical storage management
			- Content storage & synchronization
			- Data analytics with parallel file systems
			- Unstructured data store for services
			- Persistent block storage
			- Operating system & image storage
			- Media streaming
			- Databases
	
	D. Network Focused
		- Ex:
			- Bursting: Private to public
			- Disaster recovery
			- Development & Testing
			- Federated cloud
			- Support legacy systems
	
	E. Multi-site
		- Ex:
			- Organization with diverse geographic footprint
			- Geo-location sensitive data
			- Data locality
	
	F. Security & Legal Requirements
		- Ex:
			- Contractual Issues
			- Third Party Involvement
			- Data location
