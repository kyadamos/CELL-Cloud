This is the Puppet Learning VM.

This CentOS-based VM comes with Puppet Enterprise pre-installed.
The Learning VM includes an interactive Quest Guide that will walk
you through the essentials of Puppet and the Puppet language. This Quest Guide
is hosted on a server running on this VM. To get started, navigate to
http://<VM's IPADDRESS> on your host machine.

To view the Learning VM's current IP address, enter the command
`facter ipaddress`.

If you have any issues, please refer to the troubleshooting guide
included in the readme.rtf file that accompanied your Learning VM download.

We're glad to receive questions and comments at learningvm@puppet.com. If you
have an issue, please include the version of the Learning VM you are using
(this is included in the filename of the OVA) the details of your host OS,
the virtualization software and version you are using, and any details of the
site network where you're running the VM (for example, whether there is a proxy
or firewall present).
